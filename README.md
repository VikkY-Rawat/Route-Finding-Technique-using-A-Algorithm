# Route-Finding-Technique-using-A*-Algorithm
This project demonstrates the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm using Python and Pygame. It visually shows how the algorithm finds the shortest and most efficient route between two points on a grid while avoiding obstacles.
Users can interactively set the start point, end point, and barriers, and the algorithm dynamically calculates the best path using heuristic and cost-based evaluation.
The project helps in understanding real-world applications of AI in robot navigation, game development, and GPS route optimization.
